	    	<p>
	    		I am a Canadian-native developer who currently resides in Toronto.
	    		Although somewhat lost in direction, I figure my career is focused on website development. Trained in HTML and CSS, I am now focused on Ruby on Rails related. I love watching movies in my spare time as long as they're not chick flick related.
